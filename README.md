# hakka [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simon-whitehead/hakka.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simon-whitehead/hakka)
A game that you can't pass simply by playing the game. You have to hack it.

**NOTE: This is currently in "proof-of-concept" stage** and is being actively developed. This early version
is being released to test the waters to see if people find it interesting.

## Building the game

This game is built using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). You will need to [download and install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) before being able to build this game. 

Hakka requires `SDL2`, `SDL2_image` and `SDL2_ttf`.

[You can see instructions for installing the SDL2 development libraries here](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries)

If you're on OSX and have Homebrew installed, it should be as simple as:

```
brew install SDL2
brew install SDL2_image
brew install SDL2_ttf
```

Once the SDL dependencies are installed, you can run the game via:

    cargo run --bin training-1

## How to play

Toggle the in-game Console via the Backtick/Grave/Tilde key (`~` on English keyboards. The key _under_ escape on non-English keyboards).

(There is an in-game `help` command which gives a basic overview of the available commands)

The goal of the training level is simple. Fly the ship up to the finish line:

You can fly it to the finish line with the `Up` arrow. It should be pretty simple..

## Hacking the game

The game includes terminal support for hacking the game. The game runs via an emulated 6502 Microprocessor and
the terminal supports features to interrogate the virtual machine.

### Look at the game code

### Set breakpoints and step through the code

### ..or alter the game memory directly!


## Contributing

I would LOVE contributions. This is currently a single "training" level. I plan on expanding this repository
with new levels in future. If you would like to clean the code up, add documentation, __implement levels__, or anything
else, please do open an Issue and lets discuss it!
